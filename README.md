Yes, that's right, I am a software engineerï¼ŒWorking on python language software development. 

But at the same time I also like docker and linux. Recently I am learning streamlit and gradio.

My favorite band is Linkin Park, The city where I live has bagelsï¼Œand my favorite food is poutine (because I live in Montreal, you know).

How about you?
